**Description**: AgentForge: OLLAMA Menu Generator
High-level Overview
AgentForge is an advanced AI-powered web application designed to revolutionize the creation of OLLAMA mode menus with agents and selectable tools. By leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing and code generation techniques, AgentForge empowers developers and non-technical users alike to produce high-quality, customizable menu codebases effortlessly. The app interprets user requirements, generates visually appealing and functionally robust menus, and provides customization, optimization, and analysis tools. With its intuitive interface, extensive feature set, and focus on user experience, AgentForge streamlines the process of creating complex agent-based menus, saving time and resources while ensuring top-notch results.
Target Users
AgentForge caters to a diverse range of users, including:




Web developers seeking to generate OLLAMA mode menus for their projects quickly
UX/UI designers looking to prototype and test different menu layouts and interactions
Product managers who need to visualize and iterate on menu designs without coding expertise
Startups and small businesses wanting to create professional-looking menus without dedicated development resources
Large enterprises aiming to standardize their OLLAMA mode menu creation process across multiple teams




AgentForge solves the problem of time-consuming and error-prone manual coding of complex agent-based menus. It allows users to focus on menu design's creative and strategic aspects while automating technical implementation.
Key Features




AI-Powered Code Generation: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to interpret user requirements and generate high-quality HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for OLLAMA mode menus.
Intuitive Specification Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting menu titles, agent names, tool descriptions, and custom functionality requirements.
Real-time Preview: This feature offers an instant visual representation of the menu as it's being created, allowing users to see changes in real-time.
Customizable Themes: This feature includes a wide range of pre-designed themes and allows for custom CSS styling to match brand guidelines or personal preferences.
Accessibility Options: Incorporates features to ensure generated menus are accessible, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and high-contrast modes.
Multi-format Export: This feature enables users to export their generated menus in various formats, including plain HTML/CSS/JS, React components, Vue components, and more.
Version Control: Implements a robust version control system, allowing users to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with team members.
Template Library: A diverse collection of pre-built templates for quick-start menu creation, catering to various industries and use cases.
Performance Optimization: Automatically applies best practices for menu performance, including code minification, lazy loading, and efficient DOM manipulation.
Security Measures: Implement robust security protocols to protect user data and generated code, including encryption and secure API communications.
Analytics Dashboard: This dashboard provides comprehensive analytics on menu performance, user interactions, and usage patterns to help optimize menu designs.
API Integration: Offers a robust API for extending functionality and integrating AgentForge with other tools and workflows.
Collaborative Editing: Enables real-time collaboration on menu projects, allowing multiple team members to work simultaneously.
Custom Function Editor: Provides an advanced code editor for users to create and modify custom JavaScript functions for handling menu interactions.
AI-Assisted Optimization: Utilizes machine learning to suggest improvements to menu designs based on best practices and user interaction data.




User Flow




User signs up or log in to their AgentForge account.
The user creates a new project or selects an existing one from their dashboard.
The user chooses to start from scratch or select a template from the library.
User inputs menu specifications using the intuitive interface, including title, agent names, and tool descriptions.
The real-time preview updates show the current menu design as the user adds specifications.
The user customizes the menu's appearance using the theme selector or custom CSS options.
The user adds or modifies custom JavaScript functions to handle menu interactions.
The user previews the menu in different device sizes and tests interactions.
The user generates the final code and selects the desired export format.
Users can view analytics, collaborate with team members, or make further edits.




Design Requirements




The user interface should be clean, modern, and intuitive, emphasizing ease of use for technical and non-technical users.
The color scheme should be professional and adaptable, with light and dark mode options.
The app should be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
Accessibility should be a priority, and the app and generated menus should adhere to WCAG 2.1 guidelines.
The real-time preview should accurately represent the final menu output, including interactions and responsiveness.




Technical Constraints




To ensure performance and maintainability, the app should be built using a modern web framework (e.g., React, Vue.js).
The backend should be scalable and capable of efficiently handling concurrent code generation requests.
Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) is required for collaborative features.
The app should use secure authentication methods and encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
API endpoints should be RESTful and well-documented to facilitate integrations.
